# Fashion Recommendation System

# Introduction

This project is a Fashion Recommendation System built using deep learning and vision-language models. It supports multiple types of queries—text, image, and gallery-based selection—and recommends visually and semantically similar clothing items.

# Models Used

The project implements various ML/DL models to recommend clothes based on images and text queries, as well as to try-on clothes virtually:

- Image-based Recommendation: custom ResNet50 (with custom Encoder-Decoder)
- Text-based Recommendation: BLIP (for image caption generation), CLIP (Fine Tuned - for quick text-to-image retrieval)
- User Interface: Streamlit
